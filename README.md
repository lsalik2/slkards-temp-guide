## **2. Gameplay Overview**

### **Collecting Kards**

- **Spawned Kards**: Kards periodically spawn in the server. Participate in the minigames for a chance of claiming them!
- **Trading with Players**: Negotiating and trading with players can be a quick way to get your favorite kards, and slowly but surely build your kard empire!
- **Battle Wagers**: For the most competitive players, you can also participate in wagers when battling, being able to claim your opponent's kard(s) after winning a battle!

### **Kards Breakdown**

Each kard is unique from another. Along with their different images and names, kards differ from each other in rarity, series and modifiers. These traits also add strategic depth to battle, as it will be explained further below. As of version 1.0, there are 220 obtainable kards in the game, with plans to add more in the future.

#### Rarity Chart

| Rarity       | Stars | Example Kards       |   Quantity  |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Common       | ‚≠ê     | #95 - Ghost       |  77  |
| Uncommon     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê   | #113 - Ryuk       |  66  |
| Rare         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | #151 - Fruit Salad |  68  |
| Epic         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê| #174 - Chimera Mutt |  41  |
| Legendary    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê| SECRET |  12  |

Kards that have a higher rarity will spawn very scarcely, and hold a lot more value than a lower rarity kard. They also have slight advantages when battling. Each series has at least one 4-star kard, but not every series has a 5-star.

#### Series List

- **Ultimate Arcana**: These kards are named after Tarot. This is the rarest series in the game.
- **Spectral**: These kards represent abstract patterns and ideas.

## **4. Capturing a Kard**

Kards spawn randomly in a designated channel for the server. The period for kard spawns will vary between 1 to 3 hours. Additionally, kards with higher rarity will spawn much more scarcely than common kards. Once a kard spawns, a player can attempt to capture it. They will be required to participate in one of nine minigames. Each of these minigames are meant to test a different skill, and they all have the same chance to trigger when a card spawns, so the best players will have to understand how every minigame works!

### **Trivia Quiz**

- **Objective**: Answer the trivia question correctly.
- **How to Play**: Once the bot posts its trivia question, the first player to answer it correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the question `"Which fictional city is the home of Batman?"`, the first player to answer `gotham` captures the kard.

### **Riddle Raid**

- **Objective**: Answer the riddle correctly.
- **How to Play**: Once the bot posts its riddle, the first player to answer it correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the question `"What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?"`, the first player to answer `silence` captures the kard.

### **Word Warp**

- **Objective**: Unscramble the word correctly.
- **How to Play**: Once the bot posts the scrambled word, the first player to unscramble it and answer correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the scrambled word `"RDKASLS"`, the first player to answer `SLKARDS` captures the kard.

### **Math Madness**

- **Objective**: Solve the math equation.
- **How to Play**: Once the bot posts the equation, the first player to solve it and answer correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the equation `"23 * 4"`, the first player to answer `92` captures the kard.

### **Flag Frenzy**

- **Objective**: Guess the country's name from its flag correctly.
- **How to Play**: Once the bot posts the flag emoji, the first player to answer the country's name correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the flag üáßüá∑, the first player to answer `brazil` captures the kard.

### **Lyrics Lockdown**

- **Objective**: Guess the song's name from its lyrics correctly.
- **How to Play**: The bot will posts the song's genre and its lyrics, and the first player to answer the song's name correctly will capture the kard. For example, for the lyrics `"Just a small-town girl, living in a lonely world"`, the first player to answer `Don't Stop Believin'` captures the kard. It's important to match the songs name exactly, including apostrophes and plurals.

### **Number Hunter**

- **Objective**: Guess a number from 1-1000 and get it as close as possible to the bot's secret number.
- **How to Play**: The bot will randomly pick a secret number from 1-1000, and the players will each say a number themselves. The player that gets their number the closest to the bots number captures the kard. For example, for the secret number `981`, the player to answer with a number the closest to it captures the kard.

### **Lucky Draw**

- **Objective**: Enter the draw and wait to see if you'll be lucky.
- **How to Play**: Once the kard spawns, the bot will state that every participating player should send `!roll` in chat. After 5 minutes, the bot will randomly pick between every player that did `!roll`, and one of those players will capture the card.

## **6. Kard Examples**

Each kard can be expressed visually through Discord's embed system. This will be displayed during battles and spawns, but maybe you just want to show off your brand new kard or inspect the kard's characteristics. For whatever the case may be, here is a guide for it.

### **Anatomy of a Kard Embed**

- **Name and ID**: The kard's unique identifiers.
- **Series**: The kard's series affiliation. Indicated by the embed color on the left as well as the series text a kard's name.
- **Rarity**: Indicated by stars (‚≠ê). More stars means more rare, with 5 stars being the most rare kards.
- **Modifiers**: If a kard has a modifier, then it will be displayed along with a "WARNING" message.
- **Description**: All kards have a short description. These can include quotes from the kard's character if it has one, or a reference to another kard, or even little excerpts of a storyline that you need to link several kards together to complete.
- **Image**: Visual representation of the kard.
- **Owner and Count**: Shows the kard's owner, and its ID along with the total amount of kards in the game.

## **7. Trading System**

### **Initiating Trades**

- Use `!trade @player` to propose a trade.
- The other player must react with the ‚úÖ to accept.

### **Trade Confirmation**

- **Offer Kards**: Write the IDs of the kards you want to trade, separated by commas (ie: `101, 154, 200`). You can also write `none` if you are not trading anything.
- **Review Trade**: Ensure the trade is fair and acceptable.
- **Accept or Decline**: Finalize the trade by reacting with ‚úÖ to confirm the trade, or ‚ùå to cancel the trade.

### **Safe Trading Practices**

- **Communicate Clearly**: Discuss trade terms openly.
- **Verify Kard IDs**: Double-check kard IDs to prevent mistakes.
- **Avoid Scams**: Only trade with trusted players. Use `!rep @player` to check a player's reputation. (WIP)

## **8. Battling Mechanics**

### **Setting Up a Battle**

1. **Challenge a Player**: Use `!battle @player` to initiate a battle.
2. **Accept the Challenge**: The challenged player must react with the ‚úÖ to accept.
3. **Wager Selection**: Players can type `wager` to start a wager match, where players can bet their own kards. Typing anything else will decline the wager.
4. **Battle Type Selection**: Players can type `set` or `random` to choose the battle type.
   - **Set Battle**: Players draft kards in turns. Each player will draft two kards per turn so no player can hard-counter the other. This continues until each player has six kards. This is the default battle type for SLKARDS.
   - **Random Battle**: Six kards are randomly selected from players' collections.

### **Turn Structure**

- **Action Selection**: Both players will select their action that turn. The options are `ATTACK`, `SKILL`, `CHECK`, `SWITCH`, `FORFEIT`. Neither player knows what action the other selected.
- **Action Resolution**: Actions are executed based on priority. From highest to lowest priority: `FORFEIT`, `SWITCH`, `SKILL`, `ATTACK`. Since `CHECK` does not consume a turn, it does not have a priority.
- **End of Turn**: Bot updates effects and checks for victory conditions. The first player to get all their opponents kards to 0 HP wins!

### **Actions in Battle**

- **ATTACK**: Attempt to damage the opponent's active kard. **ATTACKS** can hit with a `weak`, `normal` or `critical` attack, each dealing more damage than the former. The actual output damage and accuracy depends on a kard's rarity, and the table for such can be found in the **Kard Stats** section.
- **SKILL**: If your kard has a modifier, they can activate a special ability called **SKILL**. This requires them to complete a hidden condition beforehand however (explained further below).
- **CHECK**: Checks the status of your kards, such as HP, series, rarity, modifier, etc. This does not consume a turn, so use it often! Your deck's status will be sent in a DM as to not let your opponent see it.
- **SWITCH**: Switches to another kard, at the cost of your turn. Keep in mind the opponent's attack will be redirected to the incoming kard switching in.
- **FORFEIT**: Concede the battle.

### **Kard Stats**

Depending on a kard's rarity, they can have more or less HP, attack damage and accuracy. As a rule of thumb, higher rarity kards are usually better. However, a player with only 1-stars can still beat a player with only 5-stars with a bit of luck! Let's break this down below:

The higher rarity a kard has, the more HP it has on average. However, pay special notice to the HP min and max section! At the start of each battle, a kard's HP will be picked at random between those two values. This means with a bit of luck, a 1-star can have the same HP as a 5-star when a battle starts.

| Rarity       | HP Min | HP Max |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| ‚≠ê          |  8500  |  9500  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê        |  8750 |  9750  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     |  9000  |  10000 |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   |  9250 |  10250 |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê|  9500  |  10500 |

On average, a kard with higher rarity will deal more damage than a lower rarity, though luck also plays a factor here. For example, a kard with 5-stars can deal massive amounts of damage on critical hits, being able to knock out even the strongest of kards in one turn. However, the chance of a 5-star hitting a critical is only 10%. Furthermore, their normal and weak attacks deal less damage than a 1-star's normal and weak. In comparison, while the 1-star deals much less critical damage, it also has a higher chance of dealing said critical, and their normal and weak attacks deal more damage than the 5-star's counterpart. So with a bit of luck, aa 1-star kard can end up dealing more damage than a 5-star!

| Rarity| Weak Damage / Accuracy | Normal Damage / Accuracy | Critical Damage / Accuracy |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| ‚≠ê          | 1300 / 30% | 1425 / 40% | 2800 / 30% |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê        | 1100 / 25% | 1350 / 50% | 3600 / 25% |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     | 900 / 20% | 1275 / 60% | 4775 / 20% |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | 700 / 15% | 1200 / 70% | 6700 / 15% |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê| 500 / 10% |  1125 / 80% | 10500 / 10% |

Each attack will also have a ¬±3% attack damage variation to keep things interesting. Keep this in mind if you think you can barely KO the opponent's kard with an attack!

### **Series and Type Chart**

Understanding the strengths and weaknesses between series is crucial for strategic battling. Each series can deal super-effective (2x damage) or not effective (1/2x damage) attacks to another series. This is decided by the series type chart below:

![Series Type Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsalik2/slkards-temp-guide/refs/heads/main/guide/type_chart.png)

This multiplier is hugely impactful when battling. Switching into a kard may cost a turn, but by switching into a kard that has a defensive advantage against your opponent (aka forces them to deal 1/2x damage) can be enough to turn the tide of battle. For a player to be considered a top duelist, they need to be aware of these series' matchups as best as they can! The best duelists will be aware of these matchups even when drafting kards...

---

### **Modifier SKILLs**

As mentioned before, kards with modifiers can use special abilities called **SKILLs** when available. These **SKILL**s can significantly change the tide of battle and play a huge part in the strategic element of the game. Below is a list of each modifier and their respective **SKILL**:

- **Modifier**: **Negative**
  - **SKILL**: Inverted Mirror
    - Forces opponent's kard to attack itself for half damage and skips their turn.
- **Modifier**: **Polychrome**
  - **SKILL**: Gambler's Fallacy
    - Randomizes your attack's accuracies for two turns.
- **Modifier**: **16-Bit**
  - **SKILL**: Dither Boost
    - Lowers your weak attack's accuracy, and boosts either your normal or critical attack's accuracy for five rounds.
- **Modifier**: **Glitched**
  - **SKILL**: Swap Space
    - Randomizes the series of a kard you choose for the remainder of the battle.
- **Modifier**: **Sketched**
  - **SKILL**: Vigor Sketch
    - Heals your kard by twice the damage amount instead of attacking.
- **Modifier**: **Animated**
  - **SKILL**: Fast Forward
    - Attacks twice this turn, but can't move the next turn.

To balance out **SKILL**s, they need to meet a hidden condition before they can be activated. These hidden conditions will be picked at random before the battle for each modifier kard, and a player will have to figure out what condition each kard has in order to effectively abuse the **SKILL** ability of their kard.

#### Hidden Condition List

- Get hit by a weak attack twice in a row.
- Get hit a with a critical hit.
- Get hit with a super-effective attack.
- Hit a weak attack.
- Hit a critical hit twice in a row.
- Switch in kard with modifier.

Once the hidden condition is activated, the **SKILL** button will glow blue, and the player can use their kard's ability. After use, the hidden condition needs to be met again. Keep in mind that the condition will NOT be randomized again, meaning that once you know what it is, you can use it as much as possible!

### **Modifier GAMBITs**

Due to a modifier kard's anomalous nature, when in play, it has a 5% chance of activating its **GAMBIT**! A **GAMBIT** is a sudden activation of a ability that can completely change the battle's course!

- **Modifier**: **Negative**
  - **GAMBIT**: Singularity
    - Collects the next three rounds of attacks and applies it to either player.
- **Modifier**: **Polychrome**
  - **GAMBIT**: Jackpot!
    - Doubles either player's attack damage for five rounds.
- **Modifier**: **16-Bit**
  - **GAMBIT**: Pixelate
    - Heals a random kard from either player fully.
- **Modifier**: **Glitched**
  - **GAMBIT**: Error 0x12B
    - Switches two inactive kards between players for the remainder of the match.
- **Modifier**: **Sketched**
  - **GAMBIT**: Metamorphosis
    - Revives a kard from either player. If no kards are defeated, randomly defeats one.
- **Modifier**: **Animated**
  - **GAMBIT**: Freeze Frame
    - Freezes either player for three rounds.

As can be seen, **GAMBIT**s can affect either player positively or negatively. This means that a modifier kard can backfire and cause it's owner to lose their advantage in battle! For this reason, think twice before only using modifier kards, especially in the end game.

### **Battle Strategies and Tips**

- **Know Your Kards**: Understand your kards' strengths, weaknesses, and abilities.
- **Understand the Type Chart**: Always keep in mind the typing of the kards and have the type chart handy when battling.
- **Manage SKILLs**: Use them at pivotal moments. Once the hidden condition has been activated, the kard will keep its SKILL even if it's switched out!
- **Predict Opponents**: Anticipate moves based on their kards and actions.
- **Rarities Trade-Off**: While higher rarity kards objectively have higher stats, it might be worth trading a higher rarity kard for a lower rarity one depending on its type or modifier.
- **Keep Track of your Kards**: Don't forget to use CHECK in order to keep track of your kard's status.
- **Switching into Type Advantages**: While using SWITCH does cost a turn, switching into a kard that cuts your opponents damage in half is well worth it.
- **Remember Hidden Conditions**: Keep track of your hidden conditions! They can't change once the match has started, so after discovering it you can abuse it however much you want!
- **Risky Gambits**: While GAMBITs are rare, they can cause you to lose your advantage if you're winning! Keep in mind using kards with modifiers in the endgame can backfire.
- **1-Star Clutches**: 1-star kards are very effective in the endgame due to their consistency in dealing damage. Conversely, 5-stars are good in the beginning of the battle due to their high-damaging criticals, letting you get an early lead if it hits.
